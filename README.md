# Test work AdCash

For this test work I used Codeigniter as a backend and Angular(5) as front-end framwork.

To try the application, the best is for you to have Wamp installed and put this project in the www folder under the name you choose (for example adcash) 

then you can copy the sql file "adcash.sql" in your database named "adcash"

Once done, the backend should already work just fine.

You can now go in the client folder and run the commands

```
npm install
```

Be sure to have Angular CLI and NPM installed on your machine

Then you can run in the same folder

```
ng serve
```

If everything is all right you should be able to go on [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) and see the application working.
